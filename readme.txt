== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to use Ninja Demo to use this plugin? =

Yes. This plugin will not create the widget if Ninja Demo is not activated.

= What does "Network Activate" mean in the installation instructions? =

Ninja Demo runs on WordPress Multisite in a network configuration. Each demo user actually creates their own instance of the main network site every time they log into the demo. By network activating this plugin, you make it available to each [demo] site in the network.
